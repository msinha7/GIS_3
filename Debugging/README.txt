/**
 * Debugging
 *   The .NET application in the Solution folder contains an error that causes it to print incorrect results when run.
 *   Find the bug with the StatusService and repair it.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   You'll need Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Project Rider, or another C# compatible IDE for this question.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Model
 *       These classes represent the data objects used by the Program.
 *   Repos
 *       These interfaces and their implementations are used to query the data sources.
 *   Services
 *       These interfaces and their implementations contain the business logic used for specific operations.
 *
 * Summary:
 *   The purpose of this system is to define a set of valid states called Statuses and their behaviors.
 *   For this system each Status's behavior will be defined by a Transition.  A Transition allows the system to
 *   identify which behavior is valid for a specific status.
 *   Each Transition is further filtered by a Subtype.  A Transition can only be valid for a single Subtype at a time.
 *
 *   One important requirement of the system is to know which Status objects are Initial Statuses.
 *   If a Transition object has a null FromStatus property, the ToStatus value of that Transition is an Initial Status.
 *   
 *   The purpose of this specific Program is to return all Statuses for each Subtype that are defined as Initial Statuses.
 *   These initial Statuses will need to be grouped and displayed by Subtype.
 *
 *   The Program provided should run and currently gives an example output which is incorrect for the defined Status, Transition and Subtype
 *   objects.  Please debug the Program and correct the logic to provide the correct output.
