/**
 * Small World
 *   Given a list of points in the plane, write a program that outputs each point along with the three other points that are closest to it.
 *   These three points should be ordered by distance.
 *
 * For example, given a set of points where each line is of the form: ID x-coordinate y-coordinate
 *
 * 1  0.0      0.0
 * 2  10.1     -10.1
 * 3  -12.2    12.2
 * 4  38.3     38.3
 * 5  79.99    179.99
 *
 *
 * Your program should output:
 *
 * 1 2,3,4
 * 2 1,3,4
 * 3 1,2,4
 * 4 1,2,3
 * 5 4,3,1
